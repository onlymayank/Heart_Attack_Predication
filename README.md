# Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Predicting the risk of a heart attack can help in early intervention and prevention strategies. This project aims to create a predictive model using supervised machine learning algorithms.

# Dataset
The dataset contains various attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health metrics of individuals. The target variable is whether or not the individual had a heart attack.

# Methodology
The following steps were followed in this project:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing features for modeling.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the distribution of variables and relationships between features.
*  Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones for better model performance.
* Model Building: Developing machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) for heart attack prediction.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
